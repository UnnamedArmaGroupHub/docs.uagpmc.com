# Military Installations

During extended operations, it may be necessary for UAG to establish operational-level military positions to support the mission. These positions are typically established in the vicinity of the area of operations and are used to provide support to UAG forces. The establishment of these positions is a critical component of the UAG's ability to conduct operations in an actively-hostile environment.

## Types of Military Installations

There are several types of military installations that UAG may establish during extended operations. These installations are typically established to provide support to UAG forces and may include:

### Field Headquarters (FHQ)

Field Headquarters are established to **provide command and control capabilities to UAG forces** operating in the area of operations. These installations are typically established in secure locations and are able to self-sustain an entire battlegroup for indefinite periods of time with minimal outside support. They are usually staffed by senior UAG officers and are never found without a significant security presence, supported by both armoured and airborne assets.

### Main Operating Base (MOB)

Main Operating Bases are established to **provide logistical support, medical facilities, and other essential services to UAG forces** operating in the area of operations. These installations are typically established in secure locations and are able to support multiple division-sized groups for extended periods of time. They are usually staffed by a mix of UAG personnel and local contractors and are typically supported by a significant security presence, sometimes including armoured and airborne assets.

### Forward Operating Base (FOB)

Forward Operating Bases are established to provide **logistical support and a secure fighting position for UAG forces** operating in the area of operations. These installations are typically established in secure locations and are able to support a platoon-sized group or entire division for shorter periods of time, specifically when under direct threat from hostile forces. They are usually staffed by a mix of UAG personnel and local contractors and are typically supported by a heightened security presence, only rarely including armoured and airborne assets.

### Patrol Base (PB)

Patrol Bases are established to provide **a secure fighting position for UAG forces** operating in the area of operations. These installations are typically established in secure locations and are able to support a single squad or platoon for short periods of time. They are usually staffed by a mix of UAG personnel and local contractors and are typically supported by a minimal security presence, only rarely including armoured and airborne assets.

### Outpost (OUT)

Outposts are established to provide **a secure observation position for UAG forces** operating in the area of operations. These installations are typically established in improvised locations and are only designed to temporarily house a single team for a short amount of time.
